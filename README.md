# MP3 Study App

This web application for desktops has multiple audio files that can be used to study.

## Description

I wanted to save some of my favorite study music locally, as well as create a hub for it so that I can easily access my favorite tracks as well as not worry about them being taken down.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Having the mp3s loaded is important.

### Installing
  
* Honestly, your best bet would be to copy and paste the Python script.  It's a single file that isn't long.

### Executing program

* The search query included is the one used for my homework, but it can be easily modified.
```
python3 hwExtractor.py "fileToBeShortened.pdf"
```
