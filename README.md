# MP3 Study App :musical_keyboard:

This web application for desktops has multiple audio files that can be used to study.

## Description

I wanted to save some of my favorite study music locally, as well as create a hub for it so that I can easily access my favorite tracks as well as not worry about them being taken down.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The mp3 files can be pretty heavy, but i'm sure you can see why having them would be important.

### Installing
  
* Best advice I could give you would be to clone this and then simply open the index.html file locally, I am looking into web hosting for the future.

### How to use

* Click the play button on whichever track you want.
* Shuffle button will shuffle which track is clicked and play it.
* Clicking title of track will restart the track clicked.
